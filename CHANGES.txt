 * Minimum Java version increased to Java 8

   postion (disable with packets page per of -1)
 * Allow control of the number of Opus Audio packets per page,
   to control granule accuracy. (thanks to @msalikhov)
 * Improve FLAC-native last Metadata Block detection (thanks to @croger42)
 * Fix for "UTF-8" style continuation number reading in FLAC
 * Ability to calculate FLAC audio statistics such as duration,
   eg for streamed or truncated files

 * New FlacInfoTool and FLAC Comments Tool

   a work-in-progress, and no audio-decoding support exists
